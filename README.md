# Breast-Cancer-Classification-using-ML
In this Machine learning project I am going to analyze and classify Breast Cancer (that the breast cancer belongs to which category), as basically there are two categories of breast cancer that is:

Malignant type breast cancer
Benign type breast cancer

With the help of a dataset I will create a model which will correctly classify whether the Breast Cancer is of malignant or benign type.
